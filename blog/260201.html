<p>
New year, new attempt to blog!
</p>
<p>
I saw this video on <a href = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0WUPFodAkuE>"how to make a zine in one hour"</a> 
and the one page setup with the simple line drawings was so appealing 
I thought I could maybe just do it. The hotel I was at when I started this didn't 
have a business center but the front desk guy graciously gave me a single sheet of 
printer paper which I folded and cut. This zine definitely took me more than an 
hour to make but it kind of looks like it could have taken me an hour!
